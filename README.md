# Crime-Hotspot-Detection

Excited to Share My Capstone Project: Crime Hotspot Detection

I am thrilled to share my recent capstone project, "Crime Hotspot Detection," completed in Los Angeles, spanning from 2020 to 2024. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance public safety by identifying crime hotspots.

# Project and Objective 

Project Title: Crime Hotspot Detection

Objective:

The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies crime hotspots in Los Angeles. Utilizing LAPD crime data, the model provides actionable insights to enable targeted security recommendations in high-risk areas, contributing to a safer community.

# Tools Used

Jupyter Notebook: For developing and running the code.

Python Libraries:

Numpy: For numerical computations.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.

# Key Metrics

Training Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model on the training dataset.

Test Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model on the unseen test dataset.

Cross-Validation Score: The average performance metric across multiple training and validation splits, ensuring the model's robustness and generalizability.

# Conclusion

In this project, I employed two predictive models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. After rigorous testing and tuning, including hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search CV, Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model. The final model demonstrated robustness and reliability, achieving balanced performance across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. This makes it a suitable choice for handling class imbalance and delivering effective predictions for our dataset.

While the outcomes of this project are promising, there is always room for improvement. Continuous refinement and the integration of additional data sources could further enhance the model's accuracy and applicability, driving even more impactful results.

I am proud of the outcomes of this project and excited about the potential impact it can have on public safety. Your feedback and support mean a lot to me.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my work.
